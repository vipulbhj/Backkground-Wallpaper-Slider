# Background-Wallpaper-Slider

### Why ?
__The motivation behind this came from the fact that Linux has no program that changes the wallpapers during the cycle of clock, say every 5 minutes, which is a very common feature for windows users__

## TL;DR
*This repo houses code for the whole python script, which provides you a flow routine. The core architecture works by using the power of python to do system level operations on a higher level of abstraction. It has a folder where you put all your image and then run the script providing that path as argument parameter and that it, __Like__ seriously no kidding.*
